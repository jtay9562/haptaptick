Your haptic reminder sidekick!

I don't use my Apple Watch for anything except telling the time, receiving phone calls and texts. I don't use the workout features, navigation, custom 3rd party apps, reminders, calendar, etc. For alpha, this app will be developed for my use case only to keep things simple.
