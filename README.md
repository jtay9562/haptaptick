## Version 0.1a notes
Wasn't able to create an Apple watch haptaptick app for the following reasons. Cannot create vibrations without making sounds or enabling silent mode. Cannot create custom vibration patterns. 

### Old notes

I don't use my Apple Watch for anything except telling the time, receiving phone calls and texts. I don't use the workout features, navigation, custom 3rd party apps, reminders, calendar, etc. For alpha, this app will be developed for my use case only to keep things simple.
